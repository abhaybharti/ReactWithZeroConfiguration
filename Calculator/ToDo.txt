You probably already know how these work. Add, subtract, multiply, divide… Clicking the numbers or the operations should perform the action.

For added challenge, respond to keyboard input too. You shouldn’t need to add an <input> element to make this work. If you do use an <input>, make it so that the user doesn’t need to focus the input control to type into it.

Spend a little time thinking about how the state will be represented. Do you need to store more than just the numbers on the display? When you type a new number, does it replace the display with that number, or append it to the end?

Add some snapshot tests with Jest to test that the calculator works correctly.

1. Clicking the numbers or the operations should perform the corresponding action.
2. Think about what to store in state. Just the numbers on the display? When you type a new number, does it
replace the display, or append?
3. Respond to keyboard input without using an <input> control.
