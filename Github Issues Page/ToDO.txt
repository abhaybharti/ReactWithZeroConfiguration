Start by fetching open issues from Github’s API and displaying them in a list. You could use static data for this too.

Then add a pagination control to allow navigating through the entire list of issues. You might find it useful to add React Router too, so that you can navigate directly to a given page.

For added difficulty, implement the issue detail page too. Render the issue’s Markdown text and its comments using something like react-markdown.

Start with just the list by itself. Ignore the star rating, search/
filter controls, etc.
